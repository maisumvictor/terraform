##Stacks 

In stacks level, we keep all the implementation (calling) for the modules. 
Each stack folder must be a Cloud Provider Account(AWS) Project(GCP) or Service Group(Azure). 
Raw terraform code, is considered not good in this implementation. Each Deploy folder must call a module in order to implement whatever is needed.
